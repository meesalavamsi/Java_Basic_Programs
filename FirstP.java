The main Method
The main() method is required in every Java program. It is where the program starts running:

public static void main(String[] args)
Any code placed inside the main() method will be executed.

For now, you don't need to understand the keywords public, static, and void. You will learn about them later in this tutorial. Just remember: main() is the starting point of every Java program.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("My Name is Vamsi Meesala,this is my first code.");
  }
